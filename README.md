# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This project will contain all of my *attempts* at finishing the Advent of Code calendar each year.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -e '.[test]'
```

Check all answers:
